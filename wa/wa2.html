        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <h2>Who am I?</h2>
        <p>
            My name is Ashley Stafford. I am nonbinary and I use any 
            pronouns; this means that I am fine being referred to as he, 
            she, or they. 
        </p>
        <h3>I look like this</h3>

            <img src=../img/selfPortrait.PNG title="Self Portrait">
        </a>
        <h2>What am I doing?</h2>
        <p>
            I am an undergrad in the CTD program and a mischief maker at 
            the BTU. I am currently an online instructor at IDTech. In my
            free time I like to sew.

        <h3>What are my plans for Web?</h3>
        <p>
            I would like to gain a decent understanding of HTML so that I 
            can make webpages for myself. Ideally I can create a portfolio
            from scratch (although I have been advised against doing so).

        <h3>What are my plans for <em>life?</em></h3>
        <p>I don't know!</p>
