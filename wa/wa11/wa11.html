                For this assignment most of the modifications are done on the backend. This API returns a file size and a url,
                and there is no further documentation on it. Unfortunately, some of the urls generated are .mp4 or .webm, which
                does not work with the HTML img's. So I had to add a part of my function that splits the url string, checks the
                end of the url for .mp4 or .webm, and regenerates to url if it finds either. After the url is tested then it can
                be sent to be displayed. The starting image is Miku because I already had that available from the last assignment.
                There are also several small formatting changes.
